To create admin account:

-- Replace 'your-email@example.com' with the email you signed up with 
-- (or the one you want to use for admin)

-- Step 1: Promote the user role to 'admin'
UPDATE profiles 
SET role = 'admin' 
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';

-- Step 2: Ensure Auth Metadata also reflects the role (for sidebar routing)
-- Run this if you already have a user account created.
