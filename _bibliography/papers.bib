                in clinical diagnosis, enabling early detection of abnor-
                malities and precise assessment of anatomical structures.
                While super-resolution techniques have been widely ex-
                plored in medical imaging, most existing approaches are
                restricted to fixed or integer scaling factors. Arbitrary-
                scale super-resolution, especially for ultrasound images,
                remains largely unaddressed. This study presents a novel
                pipeline integrating a lightweight model, EliteNet, with ar-
                chitectural and training modifications to support arbitrary
                and asymmetric scaling for ultrasound images. A resize
                layer is introduced at the head of the network to accept
                user-defined scaling factors, and a two-step training strat-
                egy is employed to enhance output quality. In the first
                step, the model is trained using a hybrid loss combining
                Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and Frequency Domain
                Loss (FDL). In the second step, only the final layer is
                updated using SSIM and L1 loss, preserving learned fea-
                tures while eliminating artifacts. A dedicated dataset was
                collected and augmented using flips and reflective padding
                to ensure structural consistency. Low-resolution images
                were synthesized using both symmetric and asymmetric
                scale factors. Our approach yields visually superior results
                and demonstrates better generalization across arbitrary
                scales. Quantitatively, it achieves a PSNR of 22.8018 and
                SSIM of 0.5947, outperforming existing baselines such as
                ArbRCAN, SRDNet, RDUNet, and ABPN. Extensive abla-
                tion studies validate the effectiveness of the loss config-
                uration and training strategy. This work lays foundational
                groundwork for adaptive, high-quality ultrasound imaging
                and opens opportunities for real-time, resource-efficient
                diagnostic applications.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*â€ , A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
