Well, Hi There! I am a pre-final **Mathematics and Computing** student at **MIT Manipal**. I am deeply passionate about Robotics and Machine Learning, and over the past two years, have come to know and love all the ways in which they can solve a large array of problems.

With the current pace of things and the ever evolving terms that these new paradigms are taking up day by day, I try to pause and reflect on the role of even the most tiniest components, all the while learning a host of new things along the way.
